				<h2>Proposal 2 : Auto-Installer and Easy Deployments for OpenDF</h2>
				<p> Auto installer should install the db script and create an admin account with the details provided by the user. It should also display the User Agreement and get user agreed to the terms before initialization. This includes setting up organisation details, report header templates etc.</p>
				<p> Since this task is little bit easy, we like you to work on Easy Deployments task also. The ideas is to use <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> to let anyone spawn an OpenDF configured VM within minutes. What has to be done is, write some shell scripts to install needed platforms( Git, Java, Glashfish, etc ) on top of a Linux distro and exposing the application to the outer environment. We can shre this Vagrant configuration on <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/share/">Vagrant Share</a>. Then anyone who likes to use OpenDF can simply use <code>vegrant up</code> command and visit the url from the user's browser once the VM successfully started

				<h2>Proposal 5 : Test Automation for OpenDF</h2>
				<p>GSoC is not only about developing, it is also about testing! We need a mechanism to automate the functional testing, something like Selenium may be ideal ( Cucumber test framework may also be a good fit ). If we can have a test script, a continious intrigation tool can execute these tests for every build. Therefor the task is to come up with a suitable test automation mechanism and start writing the test scripts. ( You can refer the OpenDF's test documents to get an idea of test cases. )

				<h2>Proposal 11 : Redesign Tikiri-DB</h2>
				<p>
					TikiriDB is a database abstraction layer to enable a query interface to acquire required data in highly efficient manner. After setting up the sensor network with TikiriDB It is possible to gather data without having the knowledge of programming sensor nodes. TikiriDB will provide a query language which is more similar to conventional query language with additional syntax to comply with sensor network environment. TikiriDB system is composed in three parts on is installed in sensor nodes, one is installed in base-stations and the other is installed in computer connected with the base-station. The application installed in computer will provide an API to connect the your application with the database. Query processor of TikiriDB is located at sensor node. The other part which installed in base-station node will mainly handle the routing of the queries. In this project main objective is make TikiriDB compatible with newer Contiki vision.

				<h2>Proposal 12 : Social Networks for situation mining</h2>

					The given dataset was collected from news groups who had shared their news in Twitter news blogs. These data includes different type of news areas and news topics. By analysing the news, one can define the current state of that given country. In order to make ease to follow the news, the suggestion is to cluster the news into their areas and topics. Several clustering techniques can be use to solve this problem. Thus, the research question is, to identify the news topics among the news and summarize the situation of the given country. The selected data set contains Sri Lanka news and it was collected by using 5 news providers.

			<h2>Proposal 12 : IoT Datastore powered by Distributed Software Transactional memory</h2>
				
			<p>One of the challenges associated with the internet of things is figuring out where to put all that data. If you have dozens of connected devices talking to the cloud you’ve got to think about where that data lives, how to normalize it and how to grant others access to it so it becomes useful. The goal of this project is to optimize read/write operations in such data store which can be used as a platform to build concurrent systems. Software Transactional Memories (STMs) are emerging as a powerful paradigm to develop concurrent applications. By relishing the programmer from the burden of managing locks or other low-level concurrency control mechanisms, the reliability of the code is increased and the software development time significantly shortened.

					<h2>Proposal 16: Top-k publish/subscribe model for intelligent Taxi allocation</h2>

<p>Publish/subscribe systems are widely recognized in processing continuous queries over data
streams and are augmented by algorithms coming from the field of data stream processing. Existing functions which are capable of matching publications & subscriptions in state-of-the-art publish/subscribe systems are depended on a stateless function which provides only a Boolean decision on whether a given publication is to be notified to relevant subscriber or not. But in such systems, the large quantity of received publications may be considered as a sort of spam, while a system that delivers too few publications might be recognized as non-working.
We have implemented an advanced publish/subscribe matching model to control the unpredictable number of delivered publications over a continuous data-stream, where at a given time t our model limits the number of delivered publications by parameter k, while ranks them within a size w of sliding window. A general scoring mechanism is exploited where publications get scored against personalized user subscription spaces based on the relevancy. We adopt an inverted-list data structure to index the subscription space to enhance the efficiency of matching process. Also we focus on the problem of selecting the k-most diverse items from a relevant result set, in a dynamic setting where Top-k results change over time. An incremental indexing mechanism is proposed for handling streaming publications that is based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to diversify Top-k results continuously. Our prototype model is implemented in a cloud based message broker system and we have designed it to scale on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS): a scalable cloud-service provider.</p>

					<h2>Proposal 18 : Search optimization/Text Indexing + Report Generation for AndroSpy</h2><br/>
					<h3>Task 1 : Search optimization/Text Indexing</h3>
<p>At the moment Androspy has a very basic searching facility. It is expected to improve the searching by handling an indexing mechanism. There are opensource text content indexing tools. You are free to decide what will be the best way to improve the search option in tool.</p>

<p>Required knowledge</p>
<ul>
	<li>Search optimization/index</li>
	<li>Database - MySQL</li>
	<li>Java</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>Task 2 : Report Generation</h3><br/>
<p>Androspy has a very simple report generation module. It will export evidence to a .pdf file. The development is expected to improve the reporting module in terms of below suggestions.
Export evidence in multiple formats including .pdf, .tex,, .html, .xml, .csv
Well formatted report layout: You are free to use any open source reporting library under GNU license. Currently it uses iText.</p>
  <p>Report should support not only text, but also images: You are free to modify the existing reporting module in order to give a better solution.</p>
